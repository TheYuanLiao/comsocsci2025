# 02467 Computational Social Science
This is the GitHub Repository for the 2025 edition of the course "Social Informatik" 02467 at the Technical University of Denmark.

## General course objectives
Students in this class will be able to apply network science modelling on local, community, and global scale. 
Can apply basic text-analysis to text from e.g. social media.
Has knowledge about privacy and ethics, as well as challenges of analysing data from social media, within teaching, health, etc

## Learning objectives
A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:
- Understand the history, methodologies, and core principles of computational techniques in social science research.
- Apply techniques for collecting large-scale data from the web through web scraping and APIs, and interpret the challenges and implications associated with different data sources.
- Use state-of-the-art methods for filtering, cleaning, and preparing complex and large datasets for analysis in Python, ensuring robustness and reliability in the analysis.
- Understand the characteristics of heavy-tailed distributions in social science data, and develop appropriate methodologies for handling such data to ensure accurate interpretation of research findings.
- Use network analysis to model social relations, detect communities, and apply metrics to understand network structures within social science data.
- Apply techniques to analyze textual data, including utilizing NLTK for real-world applications and exploring methods like TF-IDF for understanding textual data characteristics.
- Employ random null models to critically assess the statistical significance of empirical observations in network and textual data analyses, ensuring rigorous evaluation of computational social science research findings.
- Develop and employ compelling visualizations for both single and multiple variable data sets, enhancing the exploration and presentation of social science data.
- Identify and address concerns related to data privacy, bias, and the responsible use of computational methods in social science research.

## Content
The course is based on analyzing data from social networks data collected online (e.g. Twitter, Wikipedia, and Reddit), as well as working with quantitative text analysis and data visualization. 
The course is structured around short lectures combined with exercises, as well as a high degree of independent project work.
