# Data

In the first three weeks, your focus was on Data Collection, and your work was assessed in Assignment 1.

From Week 4 onwards, we have shifted towards exploring Network and Text Analysis. The objective is for you to learn essential tools from Network Science and Language Processing. Assignment 2 will evaluate that, and discard aspects related to "Data Collection". I strongly advice you to use the dataset you have collected, as it's the result of your effort, and you have full control over the collection methodology, format, and the choices made during the process.

Should you find your dataset is not comprehensive enough to conduct effective network and text analysis, feel free to use the dataset I have collected, available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/0pjx30ki6ixub1bwwsr7w/h?rlkey=22h3t9mad0henjml6t2fk0ae8&e=2&dl=0)
