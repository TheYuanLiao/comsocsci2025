|    1 | The data that can be retrieved are large amounts of statistical data to analyze anything from income to education and sustainability. The API is from Danmarks Statistik (Danish Statistics).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | There doesn't seem to be any paid version and no rate limit. However they do specify a limit on the amount of data that can be extracted at once, but that can possibly be changed in the future if needed. Additionally it seems the API can run in a console version on the website platform. | https://api.statbank.dk/v1/tables                                                                                                                         | Great resource! Be mindful that census data does not capture individual behaviour, but rather aggregated data. Anyways still a goldmine.                                                                                                    |
